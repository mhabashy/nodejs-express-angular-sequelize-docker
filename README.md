### St. Mina Clinic
-----

This was project I did really quickly during covid. It helps people signed up for a free clinic it has angular frontend and nodejs (express) backend. Again this was done really quickly. They needed in like couple days so this isn't my best work. I rebuild this app to use firebase so I don't have to pay monthly fee.

Node js server (src folder and server.js) sequelize orm, mysql, docker, angular app (smsmclinic directory)
